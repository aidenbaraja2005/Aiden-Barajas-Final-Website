    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    
    <p><br> Hi! my name is Aiden Barajas, a Washington native currently in my second year at Edmonds College .
         My academic journey is guided by a passion for technology which led to pursue a Certificate in Full Stack Development, as part of my CIS major.
         Looking ahead,some of my future goals securing a rewarding position in the Tech industry, and exploring the world. 
    <br><br>
         Enrolling in this class is a step i'm taking to learn more about building websites and to hone my Web Development Skills.
         I hope to master the intacracies of HTML and CSS while also having a good foundation.
         This pursuit alignes with my educational goals and contributes to the skills that will be essential to my future.
    <br><br>
          Some of my favorite hobbies are hiking in the beautiful landscapes of Washington, Jet Skiing in Lake Washington and playing video games with my friends. 
          I would like to travel somewhere warm like the Bahamas, The idea of warm beaches and clear waters have always had my interest. 
          This is something that I am excited for and hope to make a reality in the future. 
          I also really like hiking in the mountains, and forests of Washington.</p>
